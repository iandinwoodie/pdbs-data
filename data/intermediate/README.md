# Intermediate Data

## Structured Data

The structured data is a restructuring of the raw data for ease of analysis. In
its new form, the layout of the data can be summarized with the following table:

| owner-id | dog-id | event-1    | event-2    |
| -------- | ------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| owner-1  | dog-1  | event-data | event-data |
| owner-1  | dog-2  | event-data | event-data |
| owner-2  | dog-1  | event-data | event-data |

Each row represents a complete entry (i.e., both event 1 and event 2 responses)
for a single dog. Incomplete entries were dropped from the data set.
